# Spoilers for HackTheBox Nest

This is a C# implementation of the broken encryption/decription Visual Basic code found on Nest. This code only includes the decryption capabilities.

I hate Visual Basic that much, that I needed to run this in C# instead.

This repo does not contain the unencrypted answer, nor does it contain the encrypted cyphertext found on the machine, it is just a means to get one from the other.
